#VCR.py

This is a proof-of-concept start at a python version of [Ruby's VCR
library](https://github.com/myronmarston/vcr).

##What it is supposed to do
Simplify testing by recording all HTTP interactions and saving them to
"cassette" files, which are just yaml files.  Then when you run your tests
again, they all just hit the text files instead of the internet.  This speeds up
your tests and lets you work offline.

##Compatibility Notes
Currently I've only tested this (a little bit) with urllib2.  It's known to *NOT
WORK* with urllib.

##How to use it
```python
import vcr
import urllib2

with vcr.use_cassette('fixtures/vcr_cassettes/synopsis.yaml'):
    response = urllib2.urlopen('http://www.iana.org/domains/example/').read()
    assert 'Example Domains' in response
```

##Ruby VCR compatibility
I'm not trying to match the format of the YAML files.  Cassettes generated by
Ruby's VCR are not compatible with VCR.py.  The API is similar but I don't have
nearly as many features

##Similar libraries in Python
Neither of these really implement the API I want, but I have cribbed some code
from them.
